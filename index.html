            <p>So this website is supposed to hold a game of somesorts, probably one that won't work but there really is only one way to try.</p>
            <p>The following game was produced by Alhpa Juan Studios, please enjoy. </p>
            <img src="myPic.jpg" style="width: 250px; hieght: 250px;" alt="alpha juan studios logo"/>
            <p>What is being displayed is a prototype of the first project; NORT, which is designed to be a tower climbing science fiction single player story game. The importance of its success is the ability to make a profit to buy league of legends skins. (And to bribe our partner Harry to join the game like he promised almost a year ago smh.)
            <p>The game puts you in control of the character called ..... as he climbs a mysterious tower, weilding a powerful futuristic scarf that allows him to perform a volley of moves and combat foes that would stand in his way. However the need for stealth is also paramount to his sucess, alerting as few guards and moving thorughout the tower as sneakely as possible.
            <p>Bellow are early concepts of the character design.</p>
